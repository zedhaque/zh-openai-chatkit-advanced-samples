Early Wednesday morning, a small commotion formed near the western edge of Riverside Lawn when several park-goers reported seeing a squirrel carrying what they believed to be a croissant. The sighting was brief—perhaps no more than ten seconds—but it was enough to prompt lively discussion among those present.

“It was definitely a croissant,” insisted Jacob Lin, who was halfway through his jog when he saw the squirrel perched on a low branch. “Golden, flaky, maybe a day old. You can tell by how he was gripping it.”

Others weren’t so sure. Two dog walkers who witnessed the same moment argued that the object was more likely a curled, dried leaf. One described it as “far too symmetrical to be pastry.” Another suggested it might have been a crescent-shaped piece of bark.

By mid-morning, the debate had evolved from object identification to broader questions about local wildlife and the influence of Café On Main’s outdoor seating area, which has reportedly seen a rise in unattended pastries during the morning rush. A barista there confirmed that staff had “no official comment on the matter,” though she admitted with a smile that one almond croissant did go missing earlier in the week.

The Parks Department, contacted per standard protocol for unusual sightings, responded diplomatically: “We cannot confirm any pastry-related behavior at this time. However, residents are encouraged to secure baked goods when visiting any public space.”

Whether croissant or leaf, the moment has already gained minor local status. A small chalk sketch of a squirrel with a pastry appeared on the trail’s community board by evening—a sign, perhaps, that while the truth may remain ambiguous, the story has already found a home in town lore.
