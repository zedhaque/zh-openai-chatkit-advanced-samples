Market Street Deli, known for its handwritten chalkboard menus and steadfast lunch crowd, quietly introduced a new item this week: **The Hartley**, a sandwich named in honor of regular customer and longtime resident, **Evan Hartley**.

The naming wasn’t part of a promotion or contest. According to deli owner Samira Morton, it was simply the natural result of Hartley ordering the same customized combination—turkey, roasted red peppers, sharp cheddar, arugula, and a particular house-made vinaigrette—several times a week for nearly three years.

“We realized we were making ‘Evan’s order’ so often that it deserved its own line on the menu,” Morton said. “It was either that or pre-print a button on the register.”

Hartley, who works at the nearby co-op, first learned about the new sandwich when a coworker texted him a photo of the menu board. “I thought it was a joke,” he admitted. “Then I walked in and saw it written in big letters. It was surreal—in a flattering, very deli-specific way.”

The Hartley debuted on Monday and has already attracted curious customers. Some order it because they know Hartley, while others simply appreciate a well-balanced combination. One early reviewer described it as “unexpectedly crisp and satisfying,” while another said they liked that “it tastes like someone fine-tuned it over years of indecision.”

Morton emphasized that naming a sandwich after a customer isn’t a regular practice, but she’s open to doing it again if another order becomes iconic. “It has to happen naturally,” she said. “You can’t force these things. Sandwiches choose their people.”

As for Hartley, he says he’s honored—though slightly embarrassed—to have his tastes cemented in chalk. “I didn’t expect to become a deli landmark,” he said with a laugh. “But if it helps the lunch rush run smoother, I’m all for it.”
