The Foxhollow Community Center has introduced a new service that has quickly become one of the town’s most unexpectedly heartwarming amenities: **plant babysitting**.

Vacation-bound residents may drop off houseplants of all shapes and personalities, which volunteers then sort by height, species, and “general vibe.” Once arranged, the plants receive hand-written name tags and are placed in the sunny multipurpose room for their stay.

Each evening, volunteers read aloud to the collection—alternating between short stories, weather updates, and gentle affirmations. The readings are not required for plant health, but, as one volunteer put it, “they seem to enjoy the company.”

The idea started as a simple summer project but has since grown into a community favorite. Some residents now visit mid-vacation just to check on their plants’ “social development.”

The program is free, though the center encourages small donations, ideally in the form of potting soil or homemade cookies for the volunteers.

With over eighty plants scheduled for care this season, the center is considering expanding into a second room—or perhaps offering advanced enrichment classes for succulents.
