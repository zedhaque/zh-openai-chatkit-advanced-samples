Residents on Cedar Lane have grown used to a particular kind of morning surprise: a slightly drooly newspaper deposited neatly on their doorstep by Barkley, a friendly golden retriever with admirable enthusiasm and questionable route precision.

Barkley belongs to retiree Carol Tran, who says the mix-up began months ago when the dog decided to “assist” with her delivery. “He means well,” Tran explained. “He just believes all newspapers should go to all people.”

Despite the chaos, most residents have embraced the system. Barkley rotates the deliveries with such fairness and consistency that some households have informally dubbed it a “community news shuffle.” One resident described it as “a surprise buffet of current events.”

The local paper has not issued an official stance on Barkley’s method but has acknowledged the uptick in subscription renewals, citing “a renewed sense of adventurous readership.”

For now, Barkley continues his rounds—tail high, paws muddy—delivering not quite the right paper, but exactly the right dose of joy.
