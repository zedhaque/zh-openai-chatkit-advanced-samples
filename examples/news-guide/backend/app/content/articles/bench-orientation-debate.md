It’s not every day that a new bench appears in the Willow Path greenway, and perhaps that’s why it managed to spark a surprisingly thoughtful discussion among early-morning walkers. Installed late Tuesday afternoon by the Parks & Amenities crew, the cedar bench sits at a gentle bend in the path, where the trees part just enough to reveal a sliver of the creek.

By sunrise Wednesday, at least a dozen residents had gathered around the new fixture—some pausing during jogs, others arriving intentionally—to weigh in on whether the bench should face slightly more toward the creek or turned a few degrees back toward the path. Opinions were generally polite, if gently insistent.

“I’m not saying it _needs_ to face the water,” said longtime resident Nora Kaplan, “but if you’re going to sit for a moment, it seems a shame to have your back to the nicest part of the view.” Others countered that facing the path allows for better people-watching and makes the bench feel more welcoming rather than tucked away.

The Parks Department confirmed that the bench can be rotated if requested, though officials emphasized that the bench’s current placement followed “the natural line of foot traffic.” For now, the new addition remains in its original orientation, though the conversation has led some residents to propose a “bench audit” of the entire trail network—an idea that, depending on who you ask, is either inspired or unnecessary.

One thing is certain: the bench has already become a quiet landmark. By late afternoon, a pair of teenagers had claimed it for homework, and a dog-walking group gathered there for a mid-route pause. Orientation debate aside, it appears to be well on its way to becoming a local favorite.
