Main Street’s busiest crosswalk has undergone a subtle but transformative upgrade: when pressed, the pedestrian signal now emits a soft jazz riff that lasts just long enough to soothe both walkers and drivers.

The tune—described variously as “mellow,” “surprisingly competent,” and “exactly what I needed today”—has changed the flow of the intersection. Drivers pause with newfound patience. Pedestrians take slower breaths. One commuter reported feeling “emotionally exfoliated.”

According to the Transportation Department, the feature was part of a small pilot meant to test whether sound cues could reduce stress during morning rush hour. The unexpected success has prompted requests for genre variations, including lo-fi, bossa nova, and “whatever that relaxing music in elevators is called.”

There is talk of a second jazz-enabled crosswalk downtown, though officials warn against “turning the whole town into a lounge.”

For now, the button continues to play its silky tune, offering everyone who passes through a fleeting, soulful break in the day.
