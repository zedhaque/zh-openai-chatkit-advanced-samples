A handwritten note pinned to the Market Street bulletin board last week has led to an unexpectedly heartwarming outcome for two longtime residents who hadn’t seen each other in more than a decade.

The note, written in careful block letters, read:

> “To the person who helped me pick up my groceries when the bag tore on Maple Lane last Tuesday—your kindness made my whole day. I didn’t get your name. If you see this, I’d love to return the favor. — Blue Jacket”

Within 24 hours, someone had posted a reply: a small card bordered with watercolor paint swatches, signed “Green Scarf,” thanking the original poster for the chance encounter and suggesting they meet at the Saturday farmers’ market.

Unbeknownst to both writers, “Blue Jacket” and “Green Scarf” turned out to be former high-school classmates who’d lost touch after graduation. According to market vendors who witnessed the reunion, the recognition was immediate. After a brief moment of disbelief, the two reportedly laughed, exchanged updates, and spent the rest of the morning wandering the stalls together.

“It felt like watching a tiny slice of a movie,” said produce vendor Amina Iqbal, who had kept an eye on the bulletin board all week. “People underestimate how much life happens here in small ways.”

The bulletin board has since become the subject of heightened interest. Several residents posted congratulatory notes, and one suggested a regular “kindness thread” for anonymous thank-yous. For their part, the reunited pair declined interviews but shared a brief written message: “We’re grateful someone cares enough to read the board. It brought an old friendship back.”
