The community fridge outside the Riverside Co-Op has seen its share of surprises—bundles of homegrown herbs, unlabeled jars of soup, the occasional container of leftover pasta—but nothing quite like what volunteers discovered early Monday morning.

Sometime between midnight and dawn, the fridge was quietly stocked with **six neatly wrapped apple pies**, each labeled only with the date and a simple note: _"Enjoy and share."_ There was no signature, no message, no explanation.

By the time the co-op opened, the news had already circulated through neighborhood group chats and morning dog-walking conversations. Residents stopped to admire the row of identical pies, each one still faintly warm when found. Theories surfaced quickly: perhaps a coordinated effort by the Riverside Bakers Guild, or a generous neighbor celebrating the early-spring weather with a bout of late-night baking.

“We’ve had unexpected donations before, but this was unusually organized,” said volunteer coordinator Mateo Alvarez. “Whoever did it clearly put in a full evening of work. And they lined the pies up like they were on display at a county fair.”

Throughout the day, residents stopped by to take slices or contribute ingredients in return. By sunset, only two pies remained, accompanied by several bags of apples, a carton of eggs, and a handwritten thank-you card addressed simply to _“The Pie Person.”_

The mystery remains unsolved, but most people seem content to leave it that way. In a town where news cycles revolve around gentle civic updates and market-day happenings, the arrival of the pies offered a rare moment of intrigue—and a reminder that small gestures can carry surprising warmth.

As one passerby put it, “I don’t need to know who made them. I just hope they know it made the whole neighborhood’s morning.”
