At first glance, the new storefront on Hilltop Lane looks like any other minimalist café: white walls, soft wood accents, and a row of carefully chosen potted plants. But according to owner and barista Leah Mikkelsen, the mission behind **Affirm & Brew** goes a step further.

“We wanted to create a place where people feel genuinely supported, not just caffeinated,” she explained. The café’s signature item, the _Emotional Support Espresso_, pairs a double shot with a small affirmation card tucked beneath the saucer. The cards rotate weekly and include phrases like “You’re doing your best, and it shows” or “Small steps count, too.”

The affirmations come from a mix of local volunteers, artists, and customers who drop suggestions into a wooden box near the register. Some notes lean poetic, others practical. One card famously read, “You remembered your keys today,” which—according to staff—has resonated with more patrons than expected.

The espresso itself is smooth and slightly citrusy, and while Mikkelsen is quick to emphasize that the notes won’t replace real mental-health care, she sees them as a gentle addition to a morning routine. “Sometimes it’s just nice to have someone remind you that you’re doing okay,” she said.

Patrons seem to agree. “I didn’t expect a piece of cardstock to get to me,” said customer Reema Patel. “But last Thursday’s message hit exactly right.”

Affirm & Brew plans to introduce a gratitude-themed latte flight this spring. Whether it becomes a staple or remains a seasonal special, Mikkelsen says the goal is the same: “A moment of comfort, however small, can be enough to turn someone’s day.”
