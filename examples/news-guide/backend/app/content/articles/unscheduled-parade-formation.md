On Saturday morning, a minor but memorable spectacle took place along the Pondside Loop when two unrelated groups—a weekend jogging club and a loose-knit collection of dog walkers—merged paths at a narrow bend near the footbridge. What followed, according to witnesses, was “something like a parade, if a parade were invented accidentally.”

The jogging group, about eight people strong, had been running their usual loop when they encountered the dog-walking group approaching from the opposite direction. With the footbridge only wide enough for two people at a time, both groups naturally slowed. But rather than pausing or reorganizing, they unconsciously fell into a single-file line, alternating joggers and dog walkers in what one participant called a “surprisingly orderly pattern.”

“It looked intentional,” said Mary Lebon, who watched from a nearby bench. “One jogger, one dog, one jogger, one dog—like they practiced it. And everyone just… kept moving.”

The impromptu formation continued for nearly a quarter mile before dispersing. Several joggers matched their pace to the dogs’ slower stroll, while some of the dogs took the opportunity to trot proudly as if leading the procession. A few spectators cheered quietly, unsure whether it _was_ a parade but happy to support it nonetheless.

“It felt festive,” said participant Greg Yamada. “No floats, no banners, but definitely parade energy. The dogs seemed to understand the assignment.”

No official road closures or notifications were issued—understandably, as the event lasted only seven minutes and required no rerouting. Still, the Parks Department acknowledged the moment in a short social media post later that afternoon: _“Thank you to our unofficial Saturday parade for bringing joy to the loop. All participants—human and canine—handled it beautifully.”_

Though the parade was purely accidental, some residents have already expressed interest in making it an annual spring tradition. For now, organizers of both groups say they’ll keep their schedules flexible “in case the paths decide for us again.”
