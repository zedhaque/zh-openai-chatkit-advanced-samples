Tuesday’s Route 7 bus loop drew attention not for delays, but for achieving what may be its slowest full circuit in recent memory: **2 hours and 14 minutes**, nearly twenty minutes longer than the previous record.

The extended runtime wasn’t due to any single event, according to transit officials. Instead, it was a combination of small delays—a group of schoolchildren boarding with unwieldy art projects, a brief detour around a delivery truck, and an unhurried passenger who double-checked the route map at each stop before disembarking.

“Honestly, it was peaceful,” said rider Karen Moss, who used the unexpectedly long ride to catch up on reading. “You could feel the whole bus settle into the slower pace.”

Drivers and officials stress that the aim is always reliable service, not slowness. Still, they noted that the quiet, meditative nature of the loop had an unusually positive effect. Several passengers reportedly struck up conversations, while others simply gazed out the window as the bus ambled along its familiar route.

Transit spokesperson Dan Rivera said the department will review the timeline but doesn’t consider the longer loop concerning. “It happens,” he said. “Sometimes the route just breathes a little.”
